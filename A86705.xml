            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epistle is first in <hi>order</hi> of all the rest, and (if it may be said) in worth and excellency: The <hi>Author,</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 2 Cor. 12.</note> though in his own account <hi>lesse then the least,</hi> yet by the grace of God, <hi>inferior unto none:</hi> This book, (to passe by others) bears witness of it. Wherein the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Method</hi> is conceived by some to be most exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: I shall not be so curious as either to confute, or else confirm it: 'Tis enough for us, that himself reporteth, he did not use to <hi>preach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> (howere he <hi>wrote</hi>) in the <hi>wisdome of this world.</hi> But for the <hi>Matter</hi> or Argument, we are sure the chiefest Points of the Christian Faith are contained in it. The <hi>Parts</hi> are two: Wherein the Apostle is like himself in his other writings. The <hi>former</hi> mainly cleering up our <hi>justification</hi> by Gods free grace alone in Christ: The <hi>later</hi> pressing chiefly unto <hi>sanctification</hi> for his glory: That ending with the eleventh Chapter, and this beginning at the twelfth: which being next before us, may be observed to treat of duty unto God and Men in generall, as ours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men particularly: but these, either <hi>equals,</hi> as the later part; or else <hi>Superiours,</hi> as the beginning of the Chapter.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:166156:6"/>The <hi>Occasion</hi> different Interpreters judg differently of; I spare to quote them. <hi>Calvin,</hi> I think, comes neerest; His words are to this purpose: <hi>There are alwayes some men of turbulent spirits, who think their Christian liberty not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, unlesse all subjection be cashiered with it.</hi> And this was rife among the Jews; who also thought it scorn that <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, whose kingdom flourished before <hi>Messias</hi> came, should now, being come, be in subjection. Besides, there was that might equally trouble Jew and Gentile; namely, that Magistrates were so far from being godly then, that they were most bloody persecuters of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: So that, to acknowledg such Kings and Governors that would root Christs Kingdom out of the earth, might be a little uncouth to them: whence its likely the Apostle takes such pains to set them right in their obedience to Superiours. However, his</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meaning</hi> may be plainly seen in that his Propsition, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, <hi>Let every soul be subject.</hi> And this confirms he afterwards by many Arguments. As,</p>

            <p>However these words may sound, the matter cannot be unsound; you see the holy Ghost is preacher of it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>God's Ministry,</hi> or his Ordinance. <label type="milestone">

               <note place="margin">[1 Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.]</note> It were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a wrong to this Apostle, to look further then himself for confirmation of it. How often in a few lines is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated? No less then five times in a breath or two, as we say: as <hi>verse</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. twice in the fourth, then once in the sixth <hi>verse.</hi> Sure, we may use the words of <hi>Christ</hi> with a little alteration.

            </p>
            <p>And yet such <hi>giddy spirits</hi> ever were abroad the world, (and 'tis no marvell the infection reach our coasts this very age) that they durst deny the <hi>Powers</hi> to be of God, and endeavor to destroy them too. 'Tis true, they'l have some talk for this, but at this time it is not worth the hearing: The <hi>body</hi> of their Arguments have been often routed, and the <hi>carcasses</hi> may be seen in many Authors. If any think
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166156:7"/>it worth their labour, I refer them to <hi>Pareus;</hi> from whom I might transcribe, but that I hasten to more important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I shall only briefly shew you why it may be called <hi>God's Ministry.</hi> And this because</p>
            <p>First, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They have their <hi>Commission from God,</hi> as here: 'tis not <hi>permission</hi> barely whereby they stand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They wear <hi>his Livery</hi> on them; <hi>I said, Ye are Gods:</hi> Their <hi>superiority</hi> over others represents Gods <hi>supremacy</hi> over all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They are imployed in <hi>his businesse,</hi> to discourage evill, and to incourage good, as here; <hi>And ye judg not for men, but for the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.6.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>He bears them out</hi> in their service; He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, <hi>resists the Ordinance of God,</hi> &amp;c. As unto <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>He takes their accounts: Give account of thy stewardship,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Now for the other.</p>
